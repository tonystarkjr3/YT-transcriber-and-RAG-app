# RAG App

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows users to submit queries and receive topical responses. The application is built using FastAPI for the backend and React.js for the frontend.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories: `backend` and `frontend`.

### Backend

The backend is built with FastAPI and includes the following components:

- **main.py**: Entry point of the FastAPI application. Initializes the app and sets up middleware and routes.
- **api/endpoints.py**: Defines API endpoints for handling user queries.
- **models/rag_model.py**: Contains the implementation of the RAG model for processing queries and generating responses.
- **db/vector_db.py**: Manages the connection to the vector database for storing and retrieving vectors.
- **eval/eval_framework.py**: Implements the evaluation framework for assessing the quality of responses.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the backend.

### Frontend

The frontend is built with React.js and includes the following components:

- **App.tsx**: Main component that sets up routing and renders the layout.
- **components/QueryForm.tsx**: Component for submitting queries and communicating with the backend API.
- **pages/Home.tsx**: Home page that displays the QueryForm component and relevant information.
- **package.json**: Configuration file for npm, listing dependencies and scripts.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the FastAPI application:
   ```
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Docker Setup

To run the application using Docker, you can use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file. This will set up both the backend and frontend services.

1. Run the following command in the root directory:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Evaluation Framework

The evaluation framework is designed to assess the quality of responses generated by the RAG model. It includes metrics and reporting functionalities to ensure the effectiveness of the responses.
